# TachiWeb-React

React front end for [TachiWeb-Server](https://github.com/TachiWeb/TachiWeb-Server)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

There are included VSCode configuration files. VSCode will also automatically suggest installing some extensions that are important to this project. _These can also be found in the `Workplace Recommendations` section of the Extensions Tab._

I also use [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) and [Redux DevTools](https://extension.remotedev.io) browser extensions, which are very useful.

Before starting the project, make sure you have a TachiWeb-Server running (on port 4567 for development).

After cloning the project, run `npm install`

To start the project, run `npm start`

By default, you can access the project from **localhost:3000** in your browser

As of `create-react-app` and `react-scripts` 2.0, `eslint-config-airbnb`'s recommended instructions don't work. Currently using this workaround. [Link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5247#issuecomment-439360498)
